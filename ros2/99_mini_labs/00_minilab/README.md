# Mini-LabÂ 00 - Spirograph Turtle

**Scenario:**  
Turn *turtlesim* into a poor-man's spirograph: publish velocity commands that make the turtle draw pretty parametric curves.

## Interface
* radius (spirograph and circle) - can set the lengths of the petals and the radius of the circle
* speed (spirograph) - sets the speed of the turtle
* petals (spirograph) - sets the number of petals
* pen color (spirograph) - sets the pen color
