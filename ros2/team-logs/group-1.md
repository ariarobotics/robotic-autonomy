## Group Progress Notes

June 11
- Since Lisa and Shibani are absent we chose to not move too far ahead with the __Client Libraries__ section.
    - Caitlyn made documentation for them to assist with getting Colcon and workspaces working.
- Lisa, Caitlyn, and Tanishka focused on getting the assigned tutorial done instead.
    - Caitlyn finished her four sections and is editting them. Also adding Lisa's work into her section since VSCode is buggy for her.
    - Lisa completed her work on a Google Doc.
    - Tanishka has finished nodes and is almost done with topics for her sections.
- Tomorrow will mostly focus on finishing the __Client Libraries__ second of the check list when mostly everyone is present.

June 12
- Caitlyn got through everything and started working on the mini lab. Lisa is having trouble setting everything up, but we're slowly working through it (having troubles with opening the Dev Container and Linux issues). Shibani and Tanishka were absent today.
- Next week will focus on getting everyone caught up and continuing to work on the mini lab once we all feel comfortable with the base concepts.
    - Caitlyn will make slowly and steady progress that's easily explainable.
