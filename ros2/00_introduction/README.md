# Chapter 00 – Introduction

> **Goal:** By the end of this chapter you should be familiar with the ROS2 fundemental concepts and their core commands.

---

## Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
- Understand Nodes and its basics
- Understand Topics and its basics
- Understand Services and its basics
- Understand Parameters
- Understand Actions and its basics

---

## Prerequisites
- ROS 2 Humble installed ([README](../../README.md))  

---

## 1. Why this matters
All of the above topics mentioned in objectives make up what is ROS2. These topics are fundemental to using ROS2 in a powerful way and having a greater understanding of these will prove to be a useful tool in robotic applications. They are the building blocks of robotic software.

## 2. Nodes

1. **Nodes**  
   ```bash
   # code or command here
   ```
   _Explanation: what’s happening and why it matters._

2. **Topics**  
   ```bash
   # next command or snippet
   ```
   _Notes/pitfalls to watch for._

3. **Services**  
   ```bash
   # next command or snippet
   ```
   _Notes/pitfalls to watch for._

4. **Parameters**  
   ```bash
   # next command or snippet
   ```
   _Notes/pitfalls to watch for._

5. **Actions**  
   ```bash
   # next command or snippet
   ```
   _Notes/pitfalls to watch for._

## 4. Try it

> A brief exercise to reinforce the chapter—what to run or modify next.

```bash
# e.g. invoke a node, tweak a param, view output, etc.
```

## 5. Common errors & fixes (if any)

| Symptom                         | Likely cause                   | Quick fix                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `command not found`             | You forgot to `source` the setup script. | `source install/setup.bash`        |
| Node crashes on startup         | Bad parameter file or YAML indentation.   | Check syntax/indentation in your params file. |
